        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>The prisoners inside the cave are only able to view a shadow (to them, an object) painted onto the wall. The shadow is a series of curved lines that are locked into each other. These lines make up a Torus knot, unbeknownst to the prisoners, as they only see the projection, not the complete picture. The prisoners believe the shadow to be a sigil or symbol of some kind, perhaps that of their warden or other captors. Suddenly, the sigil’s lines <span class="clickable" id="first-change">begin to twirl and dance around each other</span>, elongating and contracting as different parts of the knot are shone on at different times. The prisoners are told that these are wind spirits engaged in a perpetual battle, clamoring for dominance over the other. The drive to fight is conveyed through the swift rotation of the shape. Of course, there isn’t much wind to be felt inside the depths of a cave, but the prisoners are too invested in the fierce battle to notice, or even care.</p>

        <p>The concept of Flatness can be defined in various forms and examples, but the way I see it is as follows: Flatness is a state of mind that consists entirely of acceptance. Acceptance of the circumstances, acceptance of the life one’s been given, and the refusal to make any effort to change or improve upon one’s self. Flatness is when you take everything you see at face value. You don’t try to add to or subtract from the subject because you don’t feel the need to do so. This can be displayed by some sort of sloth-like mentality, feeling more than content with the way things are, going with the flow and proclaiming that it is what it is. Of course, this mindset can be forcibly placed upon you by external forces, like how these prisoners are told to believe the battle of wind spirits. In fact, <span class="clickable" id="second-change">the fight heats up as the spirits sway from side to side</span>, gathering up energy from fighting for so long and with such determination to prevail. The prisoners are intrigued by the sight of the moving battle, yet they do not possess the will nor interest to predict or perceive what could happen next. That’s how Plato’s allegory of the cave represents Flatness. The prisoners are introduced to new ideas and concepts (albeit against their will), but they are content with things staying the way they are.</p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

        <p>Zooming out and looking at a different angle, we can see the full Torus knot in its entirety, and how it is just rotating and moving back and forth. A beam of directional light is cast onto the Tours knot, projecting parts of its shadow onto the flat wall behind it. There were never any wind spirits thrown into deep combat, obviously such a sight does not exist. However, because the prisoners have been conditioned to believe whatever the captors tell and show them on the wall, they accept the shadow on the wall to be the truth. After battling back and forth, the so-called spirits <span class="clickable" id="third-change"> come to a slow, resting phase in the middle of the wall</span>. This could show the prisoners that all creatures exert lots of energy when in combat, and as a result all creatures need to rest afterwards. In a way, this presentative method of teaching represents one of the panels on page 10 of Unflattening, where the machine is feeding the same information to each of the students.</p>

        <p>Similar to Flatness, the concept of Seeing Double can be interpreted in various ways. From my understanding, Seeing Double is being able to understand a given subject when viewed from multiple perspectives. In this case, we are able to see double in terms of the presentation of the scene. We start by seeing the shadow of the Torus knot as it moves across the cave wall, and we then see the full knot as it rotates and moves around the empty space in front of the wall. However, after the resting phase, <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">the knot begins turning wildly, now expanding and shrinking at a frantic pace</span>. The captors explain to the prisoners that the spirits have taken up a second wind, and are now fighting each other with such extreme force, they transcend between fields of vision that the human eye could perceive.</p>
